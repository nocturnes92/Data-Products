# Leaflet for R
Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps. Itâ€™s used by websites ranging from The New York Times and The Washington Post to GitHub and Flickr, as well as GIS specialists like OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and CartoDB.

# Goal 
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 



## Create Map and Add Markers


```r
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)

mymap <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=40.01077, lng=116.39204, 
                   popup="Olympic Forest Park")
mymap
```

```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-c70690903862a46b9713" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>

```

## Generate More Markers


```r
set.seed(2021-04-01)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(100, min = 39.91, max = 40.11),
                 lng = runif(100, min = 116.29, max = 116.49))
df %>% 
        leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers()
```
