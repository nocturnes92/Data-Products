# Leaflet for R
Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps. Itâ€™s used by websites ranging from The New York Times and The Washington Post to GitHub and Flickr, as well as GIS specialists like OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and CartoDB.

# Goal 
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## Create Map and Add Markers

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)

mymap <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=40.01077, lng=116.39204, 
                   popup="Olympic Forest Park")
mymap

```

## Generate More Markers

```{r}
set.seed(2021-04-01)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(100, min = 39.91, max = 40.11),
                 lng = runif(100, min = 116.29, max = 116.49))
df %>% 
        leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers()
```

## Make clusters 

```{r}
df %>% 
        leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
